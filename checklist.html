          It can be hard to know which actions or steps to take first when it comes to legal matters, and it is 
          no different with the Naturalization process. That is why we created a checklist that will guide you through 
          the most <br> important parts of it! Just follow this checklist and cross it out when you are done with each step. 
          Be sure to look at the other helpful resources on our site for extra assistance as you go through the checklist.

          documentation checklist</a> will help you know what documents to gather.
          </li>
          <li class="action-li">Step 4: Submit N-400, Application for naturalization form and the fee.</li>
          <li class="action-li">Step 5: Check to see if you have recieved a receipt notice through your email or 
            <a href= "https://myaccount.uscis.gov/">U.S Citizenship and Immigration Services login</a></li>
          <li class="action-li">Step 6: If needed, USCIS will have you take a Biometric appointment at their office. Appointment location, time, and date will be on your appointment notice. Make sure to take the notice with you to the appointment. Ignore this step if you are not required to take a Biometric appointment.</li>
          <li class="action-li">Step 7: Once the preliminary process is completed, USCIS will schedule you an interview to complete the naturalization process. Attend the interview according to given location, date, and time. Make sure to take the appointment notice with you.</li>
          <li class="action-li">Step 8: Some time after you send in your form N-400, you will receive an update on it to see if you’re eligible for citizenship. If legible, continue to “Step 9”. If the decision is continued, it may be due to failure to provide all required documents, missing documents, or failure to pass the English and Civics test on the first try. If it says denied, you are not eligible to complete the US citizenship process.</li>
          <li class="action-li">Step 9: If USCIS approved of your form N-400, you will receive a notice to attend the naturalization ceremony. Depending on the case, you may have the ceremony on the same day of your interview. USCIS will mail you a notice with the location, date, and time.</li>
          <li class="action-li">Step 10: Before you attend the naturalization ceremony, you must complete the questionnaire on form N-445, Notice of Naturalization Oath Ceremony. </li>
          <li class="action-li">Step 11: Attend the naturalization ceremony with your form N-445 (which will be checked by an USCIS officer), and bring your Green card/Permanent resident card to turn it in.</li>
          <li class="action-li">Step 12: Take your Oath of Allegiance to become a U.S. citizen.</li>
          <li class="action-li">Step 13: After all the steps above are completed, you will receive a Certificate of Naturalization. Please review it and notify the USCIS if there are any errors before leaving the ceremony site.</li>
          <li class="action-li">Step 14: Congratulations! After all the steps above are completed, you are officially and legally a citizen of the United States of America!</li>
